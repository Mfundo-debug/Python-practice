"""
Johnny, like every mathematician, has his favorite sequence of distinct natural numbers. Letâ€™s call this sequence M.
Johnny was very bored, so he wrote dwon N copies of the sequence M in his big Notebook.
One day, when Johnny was out, his little sister Mary erased some numbers(possibly zero) from every copy of the sequence M and then threw the notebook out onto the street.
Can you reconstruct the sequence?
In the inpute there are N sequences of natural numbers representing the N copies of the sequence M in the notebook. In each of them all numbers are distinct.
your task is to construct the shortest sequence S that might have been the original sequence M.. if are many such sequences, you should find the lexicographically smallest one.
Note
Sequence A[1...n] is lexico graphically smaller than sequence B[1...n] if there is such an index i (1<=i<=n) that A[i]<B[i] and A[j]=B[j] for each j(1<=j<i)
COnstrainsts
1 <= N <= 10^3
2 <= K <= 10^3
All values in the input are distinct and are between 1 and 10^3
