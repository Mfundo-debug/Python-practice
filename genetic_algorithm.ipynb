    "here's a plan for solving the 8-Queen problem using a genetic algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the problem space: The problem space consists of all possible arrangements of 8 queens on a standard chess board.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define the fitness function: The fitness function will evaluate how good a particular arrangement of queens is. In this case, we want to maximize the number of queens that are not attacking each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Initialize the population: We will start with a population of 4 individuals, each representing a possible arrangement of queens.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluate the fitness of each individual: We will evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population using the fitness function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Select parents: We will select two parents from the population using a selection method such as tournament selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Crossover: We will perform crossover on the selected parents to create a new individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Mutation: We will perform mutation on the new individual to introduce some randomness into the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Repeat steps 4-7 until we have a new population of 4 individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Repeat steps 4-8 for a second iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Output the best individual: After the second iteration, we will output the individual with the highest fitness score as the solution to the problem.\n",
